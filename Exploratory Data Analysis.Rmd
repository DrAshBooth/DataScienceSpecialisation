# Week 1

The first week focuses on R's base plotting system.

## Classes

Below we see how to create an empty scatter plot so as to add subsets one by one with differing colors.

```{r}
library(datasets)
with(airquality, plot(Wind,Ozone,main="Ozone and Wind in NYC", type="n"))
with(subset(airquality, Month==5), points(Wind,Ozone,col="blue"))
with(subset(airquality, Month!=5), points(Wind,Ozone,col="red"))
legend("topright",pch=1,col=c("blue", "red"), legend = c("May", "Other Months"))
```

From here, adding a regression line is simple:

```{r}
with(airquality, plot(Wind,Ozone,main="Ozone and Wind in NYC", pch=20))
model <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind, airquality)
abline(model,lwd=2)
```

Often we want multiple plots on  a single device, this is achieved using the ```par()``` command:

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
with(airquality, {
  plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind")
  plot(Solar.R, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Solar Radiation")
})
```

This is highly customisable:

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,3), mar = c(4,4,2,1), oma = c(0,0,2,0))
with(airquality, {
  plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind")
  plot(Solar.R, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Solar Radiation")
  plot(Temp,Ozone, main = "Ozone and Temperature")
  mtext("Ozone and Weather in NYC", outer =T)
})
```

There are actually two approaches to creating a plot. The first, we have been using already and involves calling a function like ```plot(), xyplot() or qplot()```. This automatically sends the plot to the screen after which we annotate it if necessary.

The second method explicitly launches a graphics device. The device MUST then be explicitly closed after annotation:

```
pdf(file="myplot.pdf") # Open PDF device and create file
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting)) # Create plot (sent to file)
title(main="Old Faithful Geyser data") # Annotate plot
dev.off() # Close the pdf file device
```

If you are editing a plot using the screen device and you lie the look of it, you can use the ```dev.copy()``` function to copy it to a file device. Don't forget to close the file device though!

```
with(faithful, plot(eruptions,waiting)) # Create plot on screen device
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser data") # Add a main title
dev.copy(png, file="geyserplot.png") # copy plot to PNG file
dev.off()
})
```

## Course Project 1

This assignment uses data from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), a popular repository for machine learning data sets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

Data set: [Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)

Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the data set are taken from the [UCI web site](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption):

1. **Date**: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. **Time**: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. **Global_active_power**: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. **Global_reactive_power**: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. **Voltage**: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. **Global_intensity**: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. **Sub_metering_1**: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. **Sub_metering_2**: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. **Sub_metering_3**: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

### Loading the Data

Read raw data into R:

```{r}
data <- read.table("household_power_consumption.txt", header=T, sep=";", quote="",na.strings = "?", nrows=2075260)
```

Convert date  and time columns from character strings to the Date/Time class:

```{r}
data$DateTime <- as.POSIXct(paste(data$Date,data$Time), format="%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S")
```

Subset the date for the period that we're interested in:

```{r}
data <- subset(data, DateTime >= as.POSIXct("2007-02-01 00:00:00") & DateTime < as.POSIXct("2007-02-03 00:00:00"))
```

Create the first Plot:

```{r}
with(data, hist(Global_active_power, main="Global Active Power", xlab="Global Active Power (kilowatts)", col="red"))
```

...and the second

```{r}
with(data, plot(Global_active_power ~ DateTime, main="", xlab="", ylab="Global Active Power (kilowatts)", type="l"))
```

...and the third

```{r}
with(data, plot(Sub_metering_1 ~ DateTime, main="", xlab="", ylab="Energy sub metering",type="n"))
with(data, lines(Sub_metering_1 ~ DateTime, col="black"))
with(data, lines(Sub_metering_2 ~ DateTime, col="red"))
with(data, lines(Sub_metering_3 ~ DateTime, col="blue"))
legend("topright",lwd=1,col=c("black", "red", "blue"), legend = c("Sub_metering_1", "Sub_metering_2", "Sub_metering_3"))
```

...and the final plot

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
with(data, plot(Global_active_power ~ DateTime, main="", xlab="", ylab="Global Active Power", type="l"))
with(data, plot(Voltage ~ DateTime, main="", ylab="Voltage", xlab="datetime", type="l"))
with(data, plot(Sub_metering_1 ~ DateTime, main="", xlab="", ylab="Energy sub metering", type="n"))
with(data, lines(Sub_metering_1 ~ DateTime, col="black"))
with(data, lines(Sub_metering_2 ~ DateTime, col="red"))
with(data, lines(Sub_metering_3 ~ DateTime, col="blue"))
legend("topright",lwd=1,col=c("black", "red", "blue"), legend = c("Sub_metering_1", "Sub_metering_2", "Sub_metering_3"), bty="n")
with(data, plot(Global_reactive_power ~ DateTime, main="", xlab="datetime", type="l"))
```

# Week 2
The second week centres on lattice plot and ggplot2.

## Classes
Below are my notes form the video lectures

### The Lattice Plotting System
The lattice plotting system is implemented using the following packages:

* lattice: contains code for producing Trellis graphics, which are independent of the "base" graphics system; includes functions like xyplot, bwplot, levelplot
* grid: implements a different graphing system independent of the "base" system; the lattice package builds on top of grid
  + We seldom call functions from the grid package directly
* The lattice plotting system does not have a "two-phase" aspect with separate plotting and annotation like in base plotting
* All plotting/annotation is done at once with a single function call

### Lattice Functions
* xyplot: this is the main function for creating scatterplots
* bwplot: box-and-whiskers plots (“boxplots”)
* histogram: histograms
* stripplot: like a boxplot but with actual points
* dotplot: plot dots on "violin strings"
* splom: scatterplot matrix; like pairs in base plotting system
* levelplot, contourplot: for plotting "image" data

Lattice functions generally take a formula for their first argument, usually of the form
```
xyplot(y ~ x | f * g, data)
```

* We use the formula notation here, hence the ```~```.
* On the left of the ```~``` is the y-axis variable, on the right is the x-axis variable
* ```f``` and ```g``` are conditioning variables — they are optional
* the ``` *``` indicates an interaction between two variables
  + The second argument is the data frame or list from which the variables in the formula should be looked up
  +  If no data frame or list is passed, then the parent frame is used.
*If no other arguments are passed, there are defaults that can be used.

### Simple Lattice Plot
```{r}
library(lattice)
library(datasets)
## Simple scatterplot
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality)
```

And another:

```{r}
## Convert 'Month' to a factor variable
airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | Month, data = airquality, layout = c(5, 1))
```

### Lattice Behavior
Lattice functions behave differently from base graphics functions in one critical way.

* Base graphics functions plot data directly to the graphics device (screen, PDF file, etc.)
* Lattice graphics functions return an object of class trellis
* The print methods for lattice functions actually do the work of plotting the data on the graphics device.
* Lattice functions return "plot objects" that can, in principle, be stored (but it’s usually better to just save the code + data).
* On the command line, trellis objects are auto-printed so that it appears the function is plotting the data

```{r}
p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality)  ## Nothing happens!
print(p)  ## Plot appears
```
```
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality)  ## Auto-printing
```

### Lattice Panel Functions
* Lattice functions have a panel function which controls what happens inside each panel of the plot.
* The lattice package comes with default panel functions, but you can supply your own if you want to customize what happens in each panel
* Panel functions receive the x/y coordinates of the data points in their panel (along with any optional arguments)
```{r}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
f <- rep(0:1, each = 50)
y <- x + f - f * x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)
f <- factor(f, labels = c("Group 1", "Group 2"))
xyplot(y ~ x | f, layout = c(2, 1))  ## Plot with 2 panels
## Custom panel function
xyplot(y ~ x | f, panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)  ## First call the default panel function for 'xyplot'
    panel.abline(h = median(y), lty = 2)  ## Add a horizontal line at the median
})
```

### Lattice Panel Functions: Regression Line
```{r}
xyplot(y ~ x | f, panel = function(x, y, ...) {
    panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)  ## First call default panel function
    panel.lmline(x, y, col = 2)  ## Overlay a simple linear regression line
})
```

### Many Panel Lattice Plot: Example from MAACS

* Study: Mouse Allergen and Asthma Cohort Study (MAACS)
* Study subjects: Children with asthma living in Baltimore City, many allergic to mouse allergen
* Design: Observational study, baseline home visit + every 3 months for a year.
* Question: How does indoor airborne mouse allergen vary over time and across subjects?

### Summary

* Lattice plots are constructed with a single function call to a core lattice function (e.g. xyplot)
* Aspects like margins and spacing are automatically handled and defaults are usually sufficient
* The lattice system is ideal for creating conditioning plots where you examine the same kind of plot under many different conditions
* Panel functions can be specified/customized to modify what is plotted in each of the plot panels

### What  is	ggplot2?	
* An	implementa:on	of	the	Grammar	of	Graphics by	Leland	Wilkinson	
* Written	by	Hadley	Wickham	(while	he	was	a	graduate	student	at	Iowa	State)	
* A	"third"	graphics	system	for	R	(along	with	base and	lattice)	
* Available	from	CRAN	via	install.packages()
* Web	site:	http://ggplot2.org	(better	documenta:on)	
* Grammar  of	graphics	represents	and	abstraction	of	graphics	ideas/objects	
* Think	"verb",	"noun",	"adjectiv"	for	graphics	
* Allows	for	a	"theory"	of	graphics	on	which	to build	new	graphics	and	graphics	objects	
* "Shorten	the	distance	from	mind	to	page"

### Grammar  of	Graphics	
> "In	brief,	the	grammar	tells	us	that	a	statistical	graphic	is	a	mapping	from	data	to	aesthetic attributes	(colour,	shape,	size)	of	geometric objects	(points,	lines,	bars).	The	plot	may	also contain	statisyical	transformayions	of	the	data	and	is	drawn	on	a	specific	coordinate	system"

### The  Basics:	qplot()
* Works	much	like	the	plot	function	in	base	graphics	system	
* Looks	for	data	in	a	data	frame,	similar	to lattice,	or	in	the	parent	environment	
* Plots	are	made	up	of	aesthe4cs	(size,	shape,	color)	and	geoms	(points,	lines)
* Factors  are	important	for	indicating	subsets	of	the	data	(if	they	are	to	have	different	properties);	they	should	be	labeled	
* The	qplot()	hides	what	goes	on	underneath,	 which	is	okay	for	most	operations	
* ggplot()	is	the	core	function	and	very	flexible	for	doing	things	qplot()	cannot	do.
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
qplot(displ, hwy, data=mpg, color=drv)
```

Adding a geom:
```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data=mpg, geom=c("point","smooth"))
qplot(displ, hwy, data=mpg, geom=c("point","smooth"), method="lm")
```

Histograms:
```{r}
qplot(hwy, data=mpg, fill=drv)
```

Facets:
```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy,	data =	mpg, geom = c("point", "smooth"),	method = "lm", facets	=	.~drv)
qplot(hwy, data	=	mpg,	facets	=	drv~	.,	binwidth	=	2)	
```

Density Smooth:
```{r}
qplot(hwy,  data	=	mpg,	geom	=	"density")
qplot(hwy,  data	=	mpg,	geom	=	"density",	color	=	drv)	
```

### Summary  of	qplot()	
* The	qplot()	function	is	the	analog	to	plot()	but	with	many	built-in	features	
* Syntax	somewhere	in	between	base/lattice	
* Produces	very	nice	graphics,	essentially	publication	ready	(if	you	like	the design)	
* Difficult	to	go	against	the	grain/customize	(don’t bother;	use	full ggplot2	power	in	that	case).

### Resources  
* The	ggplot2	book	by	Hadley	Wickham	
* The	R	Graphics	Cookbook	by	Winston	Chang	(examples	in	base	plots	and	in	ggplot2)
* ggplot2	web	site	(http://ggplot2.org)	
* ggplot2	mailing	list	(http://goo.gl/OdW3uB),	primarily	for	developers

### What  is	ggplot2?	
* An	implementation	of	the	Grammar	of	Graphics by	Leland	Wilkinson	
* Grammar	of	graphics	represents	and	abstraction	of	graphics	ideas/objects	
* Think	"verb",	"noun",	"adjective"	for	graphics	
* Allows	for	a	"theory"	of	graphics	on	which	to	build	new	graphics	and	graphics	objects.

### Basic  Components	of	a	ggplot2	Plot	
* A	data	frame	
* aesthetic mappings:	how	data	are	mapped	to	color,	size		
* geoms:	geometric	objects	like	points,	lines,	shapes.		
* facets:	for	condional	plots.		
* stats:	statistical	transformations	like	binning,	quantiles, smoothing.		
* scales:	what	scale	an	aesthetic	map	uses	(example:	male	=	red,	female	=	blue).		
* coordinate	system

### Building  Plots	with	ggplot2	
* When	building	plots	in	ggplot2	(rather	than using	qplot)	the	"artist's	palette"	model	may	be	the	closest	analogy	
* Plots	are	built	up	in	layers	
  + Plot	the	data	
  + Overlay	a	summary	
  + Metadata	and	annotation	

### Example:  BMI,	PM2.5,	Asthma	
* Mouse	Allergen	and	Asthma	Cohort	Study	
* Baltimore	children	(age	5-17)	
* Persistent	asthma,	exacerbation	in	past	year	
* Does	BMI	(normal	vs.	overweight)	modify	the	relationship	between	PM2.5	and	asthma	symptoms?	

Basic plot could be achieved with ```qplot()```
```
qplot(logpm25, NocturnalSympt, data = maacs, facets = . ~ bmicat)
```

### ggplot() builds up in layers:
```
g <- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))
summary(g)
> data: logpm25, bmicat, NocturnalSympt [554x3]
> mapping: x = logpm25, y = NocturnalSympt
> faceting: facet_null() 
```

There is still no plot yet!
```
print(g)
> Error: No layers in plot
p <- g + geom_point()
print(p)
> works fine!
```

We can add a smoothing line
```
g + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm”)
```

and facets
```
g + geom_point() + facet_grid(. ~ bmicat) + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

### Annotation  
* Labels:	xlab(),	ylab(),	labs(),	ggtitle()	
* Each	of	the	"geom"	func:ons	has	options	to	modify		
* For	things	that	only	make	sense	globally,	use	theme()		
  + Example:	theme(legend.position	=	"none")		
* Two	standard	appearance	themes	are	included	
  + theme_gray():	The	default	theme	(gray	background)	
  + theme_bw():	More	stark/plain	

We can specify colours directly:
```
g + geom_point(color = "steelblue”, size = 4, alpha = 1/2)
```

Or use a factor data variable:
```
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat), size = 4, alpha = 1/2)
```

We use the ```labs()``` function for customising labels:
```
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat)) + labs(title = "MAACS Cohort") + labs(x = expression("log " * PM[2.5]), y = "Nocturnal Symptoms")
```

We can also customize the smoother:
```
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat), size = 2, alpha = 1/2) + geom_smooth(size = 4, linetype = 3, method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

and change the theme:
```
g + geom_point(aes(color = bmicat)) + theme_bw(base_family = "Times")
```

When you set limits in ggplot2, it automatically removes the outliers:
```
g + geom_line() + ylim(-3, 3)
```

### Summary  
* ggplot2	is	very	powerful	and	flexible	if	you	learn	the	"grammar"	and	the	various	elements	that	can	be	tuned/modified	
* Many	more	types	of	plots	can	be	made;	explore	and	mess	around	with	the	package	(references	men:oned	in	Part	1	are	useful)	

## Quiz - wk 2

### Question 1
Under the lattice graphics system, what do the primary plotting functions like xyplot() and bwplot() return?

Answer

an object of class "trellis"

Explanation
```{r}
library(nlme)
library(lattice)
plot <- xyplot(weight ~ Time | Diet, BodyWeight)
class(plot)
```

### Question 2
What is produced by the following code?
```{r}

library(lattice)
xyplot(weight ~ Time | Diet, BodyWeight)
```
Answer

A set of 3 panels showing the relationship between weight and time for each diet.

### Question 3
Annotation of plots in any plotting system involves adding points, lines, or text to the plot, in addition to customizing axis labels or adding titles. Different plotting systems have different sets of functions for annotating plots in this way. Which of the following functions can be used to annotate the panels in a multi-panel lattice plot?

Answer

```panel.lmline()```

### Question 4
The following code does NOT result in a plot appearing on the screen device.
```
library(lattice)
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | factor(Month), data = airquality)
```

Which of the following is an explanation for why no plot appears?

Answer

The object 'p' has not yet been printed with the appropriate print method.

Answer

```trellis.par.set()```

### Question 6
What is ggplot2 an implementation of?

Answer

the Grammar of Graphics developed by Leland Wilkinson

### Question 7

Load the `airquality' dataset form the datasets package in R.
```
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
```
I am interested in examining how the relationship between ozone and wind speed varies across each month. What would be the appropriate code to visualize that using ggplot2?

Answer
```
airquality = transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
qplot(Wind, Ozone, data = airquality, facets = . ~ Month)
```

### Question 8

What is a geom in the ggplot2 system?

Answer

a plotting object like point, line, or other shape

### Question 9

When I run the following code I get an error:
```
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(movies, aes(votes, rating))
print(g)
```

I was expecting a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' to appear. What's the problem?

Answer

ggplot does not yet know what type of layer to add to the plot.

Explanation
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
g <- ggplot(movies, aes(votes, rating))
print(g)
```

### Question 10
The following code creates a scatterplot of 'votes' and 'rating' from the movies dataset in the ggplot2 package. After loading the ggplot2 package with the library() function, I can run
```
qplot(votes, rating, data = movies)
```

How can I modify the the code above to add a smoother to the scatterplot?

Answer
```{r}
qplot(votes, rating, data = movies) + geom_smooth()
```

# Week 3 

## Classes

## Assignment 2 - week 3

### Introduction

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the EPA National Emissions Inventory web site.

For each year and for each type of PM source, the NEI records how many tons of PM2.5 were emitted from that source over the course of the entire year. The data that you will use for this assignment are for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

### Data

The data for this assignment are available from the course web site as a single zip file:

The zip file contains two files:

PM2.5 Emissions Data (summarySCC_PM25.rds): This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of tons of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year. 

* fips: A five-digit number (represented as a string) indicating the U.S. county

* SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string (see source code classification table)

* Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant

* Emissions: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons

* type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)

* year: The year of emissions recorded

Source Classification Code Table (Source_Classification_Code.rds): This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source. The sources are categorized in a few different ways from more general to more specific and you may choose to explore whatever categories you think are most useful. For example, source “10100101” is known as “Ext Comb /Electric Gen /Anthracite Coal /Pulverized Coal”.

You can read each of the two files using the readRDS() function in R. For example, reading in each file can be done with the following code:

```{r}
## This first line will likely take a few seconds. Be patient!
NEI <- readRDS("./data/summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("./data/Source_Classification_Code.rds")
```

### Assignment

The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

Questions

You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. For each question/task you will need to make a single plot. Unless specified, you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot.

Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

```{r}
Emissions <- aggregate(NEI[, 'Emissions'], by = list(NEI$year), FUN = sum)
Emissions$PM <- round(Emissions[, 2] / 1000, 2)

png(filename = "plot1.png")
barplot(Emissions$PM, names.arg = Emissions$Group.1, main = expression('Total Emission of PM'[2.5]), xlab = 'year', ylab = expression(paste('PM', ''[2.5], ' / Kilotons')), col="blue")
dev.off()
```


Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (fips == "24510") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.

```{r}
# Subsets data and appends two years in one data frame
MD <- subset(NEI, fips == '24510')

png(filename = 'plot2.png')
barplot(tapply(X = MD$Emissions, INDEX = MD$year, FUN = sum), main = 'Total Emission in Baltimore', xlab = 'year', ylab = expression(paste('PM', ''[2.5], ' / Kilotons')),col="blue")
dev.off()
```

Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
MD <- subset(NEI, fips == 24510)
MD$year <- factor(MD$year, levels = c('1999', '2002', '2005', '2008'))

png('plot3.png', width = 800, height = 500, units = 'px')
ggplot(data = MD, aes(x = year, y = log(Emissions))) + facet_grid(. ~ type) + geom_boxplot(aes(fill = type)) + stat_boxplot(geom = 'errorbar') + ylab(expression(paste('Log', ' of PM'[2.5]))) + xlab('year') + ggtitle('Emissions by type in Baltimore') + guides(fill = F)
dev.off()
```

Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?

```{r}

How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?

```{r}

NEI$year <- factor(NEI$year, levels = c('1999', '2002', '2005', '2008'))
dt.onroad <- subset(NEI, fips == 24510 & type == 'ON-ROAD')

# Aggregates
dt.df <- aggregate(dt.onroad[, 'Emissions'], by = list(dt.onroad$year), sum)
colnames(dt.df) <- c('year', 'Emissions')

png('plot5.png')
ggplot(data = dt.df, aes(x = year, y = Emissions)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = year), stat = "identity") + guides(fill = F) + ggtitle('Total Emissions from Motor Vehicles,  Balitmore') + ylab(expression('PM'[2.5])) + xlab('year')
dev.off()
```

Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

```{r}
mary.onroad <- subset(NEI, fips == '24510' & type == 'ON-ROAD')
cali.onroad <- subset(NEI, fips == '06037' & type == 'ON-ROAD')

mary.DF <- aggregate(mary.onroad[, 'Emissions'], by = list(mary.onroad$year), sum)
colnames(mary.DF) <- c('Year', 'Emissions')
mary.DF$City <- paste(rep('Ba', 4))

cali.DF <- aggregate(cali.onroad[, 'Emissions'], by = list(cali.onroad$year), sum)
colnames(cali.DF) <- c('Year', 'Emissions')
cali.DF$City <- paste(rep('LA', 4))

DF <- as.data.frame(rbind(mary.DF, cali.DF))

png('plot6.png')
ggplot(data = DF, aes(x = Year, y = Emissions)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = Year),stat = "identity") + guides(fill = F) + ggtitle('Emissions from Motor Vehicles,  LA vs. Ba') + ylab(expression('PM'[2.5])) + xlab('year') + theme(legend.position = 'none') + geom_text(aes(label = round(Emissions, 0), size = 1, hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1)) + facet_grid(. ~ City)
dev.off()
